<h1 style="color:red;">I heard a fly buzz – when I died </h1>
<p>By Emily Dickinson</p>
<p style="color:white;">
<h2>I heard a fly buzz – when I died</h2>

<p>The Eyes around – had wrung them dry –</p>
<p>And Breaths were gathering firm</p>
<p>For that last Onset – when the King</p>
<p>Be witnessed – in the Room –</p>
  
<p>I willed my Keepsakes – Signed away</p>
<p>What portion of me be</p>
<p>Assignable – and then it was</p>
<p>There interposed a Fly –</p>
<p>With Blue – uncertain – stumbling Buzz –</p>
<p>Between the light – and me –</p>
<p>And then the Windows failed – and then</p>
<p>I could not see to see –</p>
