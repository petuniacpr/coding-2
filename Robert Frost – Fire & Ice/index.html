<h1 style="color:red;">Robert Frost – Fire & Ice</h1>

<p style="color:black;">
Some say the world will end in fire,</p>
Some say in ice.</p>
From what I’ve tasted of desire</p>
I hold with those who favour fire.</p>
But if it had to perish twice,</p>
I think I know enough of hate</p>
To say that for destruction ice</p></p>
Is also great</p>
And would suffice.</p>
